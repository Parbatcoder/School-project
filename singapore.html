        Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is an island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. It is located about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north.

    <p>
        The culture of Singapore is a melange of Malay, South Asian, Southeast Asian and Eurasian culture and influences. The quintessential cosmopolitan, Singaporean culture has transformed greatly over the years. The indigenous culture of Singapore was originally influenced by Austronesian people who arrived here from Taiwan. During the course of many years, Singapore's culture was further influenced and inspired by multiple Chinese dynasties and other Asian countries which have eventually given shape to the eccentric and striking Singaporean culture that we see today.
