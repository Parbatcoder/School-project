        New Zealand
    </div>
    <p>
        New Zealand, Māori Aotearoa, island country in the South Pacific Ocean, the southwesternmost part of Polynesia. New Zealand is a remote land—one of the last sizable territories suitable for habitation to be populated and settled—and lies more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Australia, its nearest neighbour.

        Culture
    </div>
    <p>
        The dominant cultural influence in New Zealand remains Western, with a strong focus on democracy and egalitarianism. Māori culture continues to be an essential part of the national identity, with ongoing efforts to recognise and honour the Māori language and Māori traditions.

        Economy
    </div>
    <p>
        New Zealand's economy grew more than expected in the second quarter underpinned by a pick-up in the services sector, and dodged a technical recession, which will help the government, under fire for its handling of the economy ahead of an election.

The stronger-than-expected expansion may worry the central bank, which has said it needs slower growth to dampen inflation, and could lead to rates being held at their highest in more than 14 years for longer than anticipated, economists said.
