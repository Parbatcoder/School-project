        Culture
    </div>
    <p>Italian culture is the amalgamation of thousands of years of heritage and tradition, tracing its roots back to the Ancient Roman Empire and beyond. Italian culture is steeped in the arts, family, architecture, music and food. Home of the Roman Empire and its legendary figures such as Julius Caesar and Nero, it was also a major center of the Renaissance and the birthplace of fascism under Benito Mussolini. Culture on the Italian peninsula has flourished for centuries. Here is a brief overview of Italian customs and traditions as we know them today.</p>

        Venice 
    </div>
    <p>
        Venice is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by expanses of open water and by canals; portions of the city are linked by over 400 bridges. The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers.

        Rome
    </div>
    <p>
        Rome was called the “Eternal City” by the ancient Romans because they believed that no matter what happened in the rest of the world, the city of Rome would always remain standing. Exploring the city center by foot surrounded by glorious monuments and colossal remains takes you back in time to the “glory that was Rome”.

        Lake Como
    </div>
    <p>A gorgeous spot that’s a convenient day trip from Milan, Lake Como recently earned fame as home to Hollywood star George Clooney. But celeb-spotting aside, it’s known for jaw-dropping natural beauty, elegant old villas—and the scenic towns surrounding the lake. Check out Varenna, Bellagio, and Menaggio, which offer great views, historic churches, and water-based activities such as ferries and passenger-only boats.</p>

        Florence
    </div>
    <p>
        There’s no better place for Renaissance art and architecture than Florence—from the Galleria dell’Accademia (home to Michelangelo’s David) to the cathedrals and arches that make up the Piazzale Michelangelo. But just beyond the main sights, you’ll find some of the city’s off-the-beaten-path gems, with (bonus) way less crowds. San Miniato al Monte is worth the climb for the frescoes and unbeatable views. Oltrarno, just across the river, offers plenty of vintage shops, boutiques, and cool cafes. When in doubt, do as the locals do: Post up in a piazza with a plate of fresh tagliatelle and a glass of Chianti and watch the city go by.
